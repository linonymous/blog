## Hey, I'm Linonymous

I'm a software engineer passionate about distributed systems, databases, and backend engineering. This blog — **Mindfork** — is where I document my learnings, break down complex technical concepts, and occasionally share thoughts on life beyond code.

## Why "Mindfork"?

In Unix, a `fork()` creates a new process — a divergent path of execution. **Mindfork** represents those moments when an idea splits off in your mind, taking on a life of its own. Every post here is a fork of thought, exploring a new direction.

## The Tagline

*"I write, so that I may learn."*

Writing forces clarity. When I can explain something in writing, I truly understand it. This blog is as much a learning tool for me as it hopefully is for you.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Tech**: System design, backend engineering, databases, and code
- **Deep Dives**: Long-form paper reviews and architecture explorations
- **TIL**: Quick daily learnings and discoveries
- **Musings**: Personal reflections and career thoughts
